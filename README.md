# StardewValleyHelper
Helper program for games similar to Stardew Valley. It maintains and updates (manually) a database of all the characters in the game and the gifts that they prefer and dislike.
## Current Work
Cleaning main program.
## Database
This program uses a basic text file as a database. However `Characters.txt` is only an example of a text file. If you wish to use this program, just create a blank text file and change the `FILENAME` constant in `StardewValley.java` to be the name of that file.
